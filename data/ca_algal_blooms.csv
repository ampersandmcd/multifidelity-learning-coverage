6/23/17: Pictures taken by a resident at Blue Lakes show accumulation of whitish scum along the shoreline. This indicates an active cyanobacteria bloom at Upper Blue Lake. 

6/22/17:  On June 21, 2017 the  Elem Indian Colony collected samples from two locations. They observed small areas of white scum.  Potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria where identified in all of the samples.  No toxins were detected using Abraxis test strips.  The samples have been sent to a laboratory for further analysis. 

06/16/17:  Dolichospermum, a potentially toxin producing cyanobacteria, has been identified in both upper and lower Blue Lakes.  Visual and microscope observations indicate low cell density and that there is not currently a bloom occurring, although further investigation is needed.

Therefore, due to visual indicators and lab results, we recommend that the advisory signs be removed but that the public continue to be aware that blooms can reoccur and should look out for the common signs of an algal bloom. 

9/11/20: In an effort to prevent confusion in our public messaging concerning the sampling results collected at Lake Hemet at the end of August, Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board Staff has decided to update the advisory for Lake Hemet to a Lake wide Danger advisory

8/27/2020-Santa Ana Regional Water Board Staff sampled Lake Hemet on August 21, 2020 at the Campground Boat Launch, Campground North East Corner, and the North Shore. Lake Hemet North Shore had visual indicators of cyanobacteria and sampling results indicate high levels of Microcystin toxins are present.

10/30/2020: Red Lake is currently posted with Danger Level Advisories. Based on most recent lab results, CDFW plans to down-grade from Danger to Warning Level the week of 11/02/2020. 
10/29/2020: Results from samples collected by AWG at Red Lake on 10/20/2020 available: Shoreline 1 sample (16.87 ug/L) and Shoreline 2 sample (9.62 ug/L), still fall between the Warning (6 ug/L) and Danger (20 ug/L) Action Trigger Levels. Both Tributary samples are non-detect, and results for the outlet -Red Lake Creek sample(1.62 ug/L) dropped significantly from Sept, but still falls between the Caution and Warning Action Trigger Levels. 

Water Board staff recommend resampling in November.

9/26/2020: CDFW posted Danger signs at both drive-up entrances, on the dam, and a trail leading up to the dam. 

9/25/2020: Alpine County Public Health Officer issued a Public Health Brief 

9/25/20: Microcystins (MC) levels measured at one of two shoreline sites were 2,389.5 ug/L which significantly exceeds the established Danger Level trigger for Human and Animal Health of 20 ug/L. Levels of MC were much lower for a second shoreline sample (17.54 ug/L), but were approaching the Danger Trigger Level. Levels of MC measured in a third sample collected from Red Lake Creek were 4.96 ug/L and approaching the Warning Level trigger (6 ug/L). 
Additional samples were collected from two tributaries draining into the lake, but cyanotoxin analysis was not performed because only diatoms, no cyanobacteria cells, were observed with microscopy identification.
Danger signs recommended and will be posted by Dept. of Fish and Wildlife on 9/26.


8/27/20: At two of the sample locations cyanobacteria was not observed. The other three locations contained non-detectable amounts of anatoxin-a and cylindrospermopsin. These three locations detected low amounts of microcystin, but all were below the Caution Trigger Level (0.8 ug/L).

8/5/2020: Results from sampling conducted by AWG  on 07/28/2020 indicate the following: Microscopy results for one shoreline sample indicated the presence of Microcystis sp. And Dolichospermum. Microscopy results for the Red Lake Creek sample showed the presence of low amount of Microcystis. Toxin analysis (ELISA method) performed on the Red Lake Creek sample indicated microcystin at 3.85 ug/L.
Since this toxin level falls within the Caution Level Advisory Level range, Water Board staff requested CDFW post Caution Level Advisories.  An additional shoreline sample detected microcystin at 0.21 ug/L, which is I below the 0.8 ug/L Caution Action Trigger.  

CDFW will be posting Caution Level Advisories signs on Friday, Aug. 7. 


6/24/2020:  Results from 06/16/2020 Sampling Event- Microscopy identification of the Red Lake samples (shoreline, tributaries, and outlet creek) indicated the presence of potentially toxigenic cyanobacteria Dolichospermum sp. In all samples but the 633RLTR01 (Red Lake Tributary 1) sample. Analysis to quantify total toxin producing cyanobacteria by toxin class using qPCR methods did not indicate the presence of any toxin producing gene copies. As such, cyanotoxin analysis was not performed on the water samples. 

CDFW staff were notified  of the results in the event that the information may be used to inform fish stocking or other CDFW activities at Red Lake. 


05/27/2020 - No cyanotoxins (anatoxin-a and microcystin/nodularin) were detectedby ELISA method in the two shoreline samples that were sent for analysis.
 Microscope photos and identification of potentially toxigenic (PTOX) cyanobacteria did indicate low levels of Dolichospermum in one sample and a moderate amount of diatoms in the other sample.

05/19/2020 - AWG and CDFW are collecting the first set of samples associated with a monitoring plan that includes monthly sample collection. Results will be posted when received.

A hunter was hunting with his dog on Saturday, November 2, 2019 at the Wister Wildlife Unit, cell# y15-b2, along with his hunting dog (Chocolate Lab, 5-years old, 65 pounds). He described his dog as being very healthy and fit prior to the incident. While hunting, the dog was exposed to the water between the hours of 7:00am-2:00pm. The hunter said he did not observe a bloom, but he described the water as stagnant. Late Sunday night/ early Monday morning, the hunter noticed that his dog was in distress. He said the dog appeared to have lost control of its body movements and was shaking. The dog was taken to a veterinarian, and then to an animal hospital where the vet observed convulsions, irregular heartbeat, fluid on the lungs, and both liver and brain damage. The animal was subsequently euthanized on Monday morning. Neither veterinarian could determine the cause of the dogs condition, however, the described symptoms are consistent with known cyanotoxin exposure, and cyanotoxins have been observed in Salton Sea wetlands in the past. In response to the incident, the Imperial County Health Department promptly posted caution level signage in the vicinity, and literature pertaining to HABs is being provided to CDFW staff.",CAUTION,"Wister Unit Wetlands, Cell Y15B2",12/10/2019,Suspected illness,TRUE
